# ProjectTourOfHeroes
Welcome to my personal GitHub repository dedicated to my journey with the Tour of Heroes project! Within this repository, you'll find the code and resources related to my exploration of Angular's core concepts. Join me as I learn about components, services, routing, and data binding through the development of the Tour of Heroes application.
